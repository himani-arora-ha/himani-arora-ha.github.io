<p style="margin:0 0 5px;"><a href="javascript:toggle(0)">Abstract<span id="pubabslink_0"> (click to expand)</span></a><span id="pubabs_0" style="display:none;">: Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) are hybrid materials based on crystalline coordination polymers that consist of metal ions connected by organic ligands. In addition to the traditional applications in gas storage and separation or catalysis, the long-range crystalline order in MOFs, as well as the tunable coupling between the organic and inorganic constituents, has led to the recent development of electrically conductive MOFs as a new generation of electronic materials. However, to date, the nature of charge transport in the MOFs has remained elusive. Here we demonstrate, using high-frequency terahertz photoconductivity and Hall effect measurements, Drude-type band-like transport in a semiconducting, π–d conjugated porous Fe3(THT)2(NH4)3 (THT, 2,3,6,7,10,11-triphenylenehexathiol) two-dimensional MOF, with a room-temperature mobility up to ~ 220 cm2 V–1 s–1. The temperature-dependent conductivity reveals that this mobility represents a lower limit for the material, as mobility is limited by impurity scattering. These results illustrate the potential for high-mobility semiconducting MOFs as active materials in thin-film optoelectronic devices.

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;"><a href="javascript:toggle(1)">Abstract<span id="pubabslink_1"> (click to expand)</span></a><span id="pubabs_1" style="display:none;">: Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) are emerging as an appealing class of highly tailorable electrically conducting materials with potential applications in optoelectronics. Yet, the realization of their proof‐of‐concept devices remains a daunting challenge, attributed to their poor electrical properties. Following recent work on a semiconducting Fe3(THT)2(NH4)3 (THT: 2,3,6,7,10,11‐triphenylenehexathiol) 2D MOF with record‐high mobility and band‐like charge transport, here, an Fe3(THT)2(NH4)3 MOF‐based photodetector operating in photoconductive mode capable of detecting a broad wavelength range from UV to NIR (400–1575 nm) is demonstrated. The narrow IR bandgap of the active layer (≈0.45 eV) constrains the performance of the photodetector at room temperature by band‐to‐band thermal excitation of charge carriers. At 77 K, the device performance is significantly improved; two orders of magnitude higher voltage responsivity, lower noise equivalent power, and higher specific detectivity of 7 × 108 cm Hz1/2 W−1 are achieved under 785 nm excitation. These figures of merit are retained over the analyzed spectral region (400–1575 nm) and are commensurate to those obtained with the first demonstrations of graphene‐ and black‐phosphorus‐based photodetectors. This work demonstrates the feasibility of integrating conjugated MOFs as an active element into broadband photodetectors, thus bridging the gap between materials&#39; synthesis and technological applications.</span></p>
