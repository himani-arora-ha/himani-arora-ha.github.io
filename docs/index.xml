      <description>I received my Ph.D. in Physics from TU Dresden (Germany) in 2020 and am currently working as a postdoctoral researcher at Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf (HZDR). My research is focused on the characterization and integration of nanoscale materials and their heterostructures into electronic devices (transistors, photodetectors, and sensors). During my career, I have worked in rigorous and challenging work environments at world-renowned organizations in India, Europe, and the United States. Leading (sometimes) inter-disciplinary and multinational teams has enabled me to quickly learn new methods and smoothly integrate into new environments.</description>
