Welcome to my website! I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf  [HZDR](https://hzdr.de). I received my Ph.D. in Physics from TU Dresden in 2020. My research is about ultra-thin semiconductors and their electronic applications.

  {{< figure link="/images/adma_backcover.jpg" thumb="-thumb" caption="Advanced Materials Back Cover" alt="Advanced Materials Back Cover: We demonstrate broadband photodetectors based on a novel π–d conjugated Fe3(THT)2(NH)3 2D metal–organic framework (MOF), operative in the UV‐to‐NIR range. Due to the small IR bandgap of the MOF, the photodetectors are best operated at cryogenic temperatures by suppressing the thermally activated charge‐carrier population. Thus, a proof‐of‐concept MOF photodetector is reported, revealing MOFs as promising candidates for optoelectronics." >}}
