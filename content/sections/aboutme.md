I received my Ph.D. in Physics from TU Dresden (Germany) in 2020 and am currently working as a postdoctoral researcher at Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf <a href="https://www.hzdr.de/db/!ContMan.Visi.Card?pNid=2760&pUser=113526" target="_blank">(HZDR)</a>. Prior to that, I completed my Bachelor’s in Metallurgical Engineering from IIT-BHU (India) and Master’s in Advanced Functional Materials, jointly from the University of Augsburg (Germany) and the Institut polytechnique de Grenoble (France) under Erasmus Mundus Scholarship Program.

My research is focused on the characterization and integration of nanoscale materials and their heterostructures into electronic devices (transistors, photodetectors, and sensors). 

During my career, I have worked at world-renowned organizations in India, Europe, and the United States. Leading (sometimes) inter-disciplinary and multinational teams has enabled me to quickly learn new methods and smoothly integrate into new environments. I am a firm believer that learning continues throughout one’s life. Hence, I try to indulge myself in new challenges and to hone new skills to broaden my abilities and limits.

Due to the small IR bandgap of the MOF, the photodetectors are best operated at cryogenic temperatures by suppressing the thermally activated charge‐carrier population. Thus, a proof‐of‐concept MOF photodetector is reported, revealing MOFs as promising candidates for optoelectronics." >}}
